Repo contains 3 files for the project code:

ML_Colour_Preprocess.ipynb was early stage image preprocessing that ended up hindering the accuracy when tested on pre-built model. It was not used going forward.

Project_ML.ipynb contains hair removal and image sharpening preprocessing stages, followed by initial testing on pre-built models. These preprocessing steps were used going forward.

Project_Final_Code.ipynb contains the results of all models compiled for the project, including relevant preprocessing.
